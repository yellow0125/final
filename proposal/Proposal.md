problems of current recipe platforms

We are more focus on meeting more friends have the same taste of food.

#### Q5 What is innovative about your app idea? What will be particularly surprising or elegant about the concept?
In current market, there are either social media app or cooking teaching app. Our Foofriend is an unique
app combine both social & cooking features. In this app, people can make friends who have similar taste 
or can share their own receipts to become a cheif KOL. 
As a social media app, we focus only in cooking. As a receipt sharing app, we have social features.

#### Q6 What about your app will keep people engaged using it for a long time, even once the novelty wears off?
- Eating is one of the basic desire from human. 
- We would make policies to encourage our user share their new receipts in a certain frequency, which 
would enlarge our content and keep attracking our users
- Because of social feature, our user need check from time to time to see if any message/ updates.

#### Q7 What are the top potential weaknesses of your application idea and how will you address them?
- Not all people are foodie, so the population of our target user is a question. To solve this problem,
we can increase our attractness for the target user and increase their stickness to our app.
- As a social media app, the initial marketing of our app is important. We need consider how to 
attract people to user our app, how to make good content as soon as possible to retain our customer.
To solve this problem, we can make content encouraging policy and reward our user if they share
their receipts in our app.


#### Q8 Will you be able to design, build, and test this app before the end of the semester?
-Yes. There are very mature apps for both social media and cooking that we can refer to.
