## Install dependencies
In order to install, clone this repository and run:

> npm install  
//OR  
>yarn install

This was made with Expo, so you need it to run. To do it, run:
> npm start  
 //OR  
> npm expo start --tunnel

This starts the Metro Bundler. You can simulate the app in an Android emulator (such as in Android Studio) or in your own device, Android or iOS powered, by downloading the Expo App.
